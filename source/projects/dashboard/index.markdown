Puppet Dashboard
================

Puppet Dashboard is a web front end that keeps you informed and in control of everything going on in your Puppet ecosystem. It currently functions as a [node configuration tool](#node_configuration) and [a reporting dashboard](#reporting) and will soon do much more, including having better marketing copy.

## Node Configuration

The Puppet Dashboard can be used to manage Puppet node configuration by applying classes and parameters to individual nodes and to groups of nodes. Parameters can be entered as simple key-value pairs and classes can be selected from a list. These attributes will be exported in YAML format, allowing Puppet Dashboard to function as an external node tool.

### Node Groups

## Reporting

### Puppet Run Reports

Puppet Dashboard shows all puppet run reports generated for each node in the system. It will automatically add nodes for reports it receives that do not match a preexisting node.
