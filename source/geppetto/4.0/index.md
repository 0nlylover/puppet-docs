##What is Geppetto?

Geppetto is an integrated development environment for Puppet. In other words, it is a simplified toolset for developing and integrating Puppet modules and manifests.

Built on Eclipse, Geppetto provides a puppet manifest editor that provides syntax highlighting, content assistance, error tracing/debugging, and code completion features. It also includes a puppet module editor and an interface to the [Puppet Forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/), which allows you to create projects from existing modules on the Forge as well as easily upload your custom modules. Geppetto is even integrated with git and SVN, enabling side-by-side comparison of code from a given repo complete with highlighting, code validation, syntax error parsing, and expression troubleshooting. 

It even offers an integration with Puppet Enterprise, giving you an additional resource view and error information.

Geppetto is packaged so it can be downloaded and used immediately. It contains a full installation Eclipse, meaning you can install tools as you would with the regular Eclipse IDE, and it handles multiple versions of Puppet, allowing you set the version that you're working with.

##Basic Overview

![IDE_overview][IDE_overview]

Here's how Geppetto looks with a fresh or first-time install. Your version might be a little different, either because you added Geppetto to an existing install of Eclipse that you'd already customized, or because you changed some of the panes around when you first installed. If your panes are arranged a little differently, you'll still get all the same functionality.

In this image, you see some of the most common work areas:

The **Project Explorer** enables you to easily navigate around in your project's file structure. 


##Installing Geppetto
You can install Geppetto as an all-in-one download that includes GitHub or Eclipse Subversive, a project that integrates Apache Subversion with Eclipse. Or, if you're already using Eclipse, you can install Geppetto into your existing development environment.

Geppetto is available in 32 and 64-bit versions for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Because the all-in-one download doesn't contain Java development tools, it's smaller than adding Geppetto to an existing Eclipse install.

###Install Geppetto as an All-In-One Download
1. Download the appropriate version of Geppetto [here](http://puppetlabs.github.io/geppetto/download.html).
2. Unzip and run Geppetto.

###Add Geppetto to an Existing Version of Eclipse
1. In Eclipse, click **Help** -> **Install New Software**.
2. In the **Work with** box, add this link: http://updates.puppetlabs.com/geppetto

	This URL is for use with a download manager. It's not meaningful to visit it with a browser.

3. Select Geppetto in the available software list, and then click **Next**.

4. Accept the license agreement and click **Finish**.

5. Close and reopen Eclipse.

**Note:** Using these steps, you can get support for Ruby coding by installing the Eclipse [Dynamic Languages Toolkit](http://www.eclipse.org/dltk/). Just be aware that the DLTK isn't supported by Puppet Labs.

##Working with Puppet Projects in Geppetto
Geppetto enables you to work with Puppet projects in a variety of ways. 

**Create new projects**  Work on new Puppet projects, Puppet modules, or Puppet projects based on [Forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/) modules. You can create new projects based on existing projects from your local file system, and from GitHub or Apache Subversion.

**Create new repositories**  You can create new repositories on GitHub or Subversion, and then populate those repositories with new or existing Puppet projects.

**Import and export projects**  From GitHub or Subversion, import existing Puppet projects, edit them, and then export them back to the repository that they came from. You can also publish modules directly to the Forge.

The following are some basic steps to get started with Puppet projects in Geppetto.

###Create New Puppet Projects
1. In Geppetto, click **File -> New -> Project** to open the **Select a wizard** dialog box.
	If the **Select a wizard** box doesn't open, for example, if you have previously created a project, click **File -> New -> Other**.
3. Expand the **Puppet** folder, and click **Puppet Project**.

	You can select a Puppet Module or Puppet Module from the Forge in this location as well.
4. Click **Next**, name the project, and click **Finish**.

	Now, start coding your Puppet project in Geppetto.

###Create a New Module from an Existing Module
1. Click **File -> New -> Project**.
2. In the **Select a wizard** dialog box, expand the Puppet folder, click **Puppet Project from Existing Forge Module**, and then click **Next**.
3. Next to the **Module** text box, click the **Select** button, enter a keyword, such as "mongodb", and then click **OK**. 
4. Select a module from the list that's returned, and then click **OK**. 
5. Select the folder you want to import the module to, and then click **Finish**. 
    The module is now displayed in your Project Explorer.
	
###Create New Repositories
1. Click **File -> New -> Other**.
2. In the **Select a wizard** dialog box, expand the **Git** folder, click **Git Repository**, and click **Next**.
3. Browse to the path for the new repository, give it a name, and click **Finish**.


	The steps are pretty similar to set up a Subversion repository. In that case, expand the **SVN** list and click **Repository Location**. Then provide the appropriate information in the wizard.

####Add a Repositories Pane to the IDE
To easily interact with Git or SVN repositories in Geppetto, add the repositories pane to the IDE. From the Git Repositories tab, you can:

*Manage a local repo clone from Geppetto
*Clone a remote repository to your local machine and then add it to the IDE
*Create a new local clone

From the SVN Repositories tab, you can:
*Set a new repository location
*Create a repository

To add the repository pane, in Geppetto, click **Window ->Show View -> Other -> Git -> Git Repositories** or **Window ->Show View -> Other -> SVN -> SVN Repositories**.

For more information about interacting with Git or SVN from Geppetto, refer to the EGit and Subversive user guides. On the Geppetto Help menu, click **Help Contents** to open the guides.

###Editing module metadata


All Puppet modules include a metadata file, which contains high level information about the module (version, author, license, dependencies, et cetera). Geppetto's editor provides an easy way to modify this metadata. 

If you create a module using Geppetto's Project Wizard, you will have access to the same metadata editor through either the Modulefile or metadata.json. 

If you have pulled a module from the [Puppet Forge](forge.puppetlabs.com) or a Git/SVN repo, you may edit the metadata via Modulefile or metadata.json, whichever is available. Whether there will be a Modulefile or not depends upon how that module was built. Upon pulling a module from the Puppet Forge, Geppetto will open the Modulefile or metadata.json in the editor automatically. 

Opening the metadata editor will bring you to the *Overview* screen. The *Overview* screen will display your metadata in individual text fields for editing. This metadata is split into two groups: *General Information* and *Details*.  

Within *General Information*: 

* **Name**: This field is unique as it has two text fields separated by a '-'. If you are planning to upload your module to the Puppet Forge at any point, the first field should contain your Puppet Forge username. The second field should contain the name of your module. (For more information on module naming, see [here](docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/modules_publishing.html#a-note-on-module-names))
* **Version**: Your module's current version number. It is important that this is kept up-to-date, as it impacts the ability for your modules to connect with one another via dependencies. We highly recommend using [semver](http://semver.org/) to guide your versioning. 
* **Author**: The name of the module's author.
* **License**: Any applicable license guiding the module's use. 

Within *Details*:

* **Source**: The repo where the module lives. If you used Geppetto to create your module, you can ignore this. 
* **Project Page**: The GitHub page where the module's source code is published. 
* **Summary**: A brief description of the module's functionality.
* **Description**: Originally, this was a space to give some more detailed information about your module, but this feature is being deprecated. Please enter detailed information about your module in the [README](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/modules_documentation.html).

If your module requires capabilities or functionality provided by another module in order to run properly, your module is dependent on that other module. From the *Dependencies* tab, you can add, delete, or edit dependencies for your module. 

To add a dependency:

1. Click the **Add...** button. 
2. Choose the module from the list of modules in your environment, and specify the version range (for instance, `>= 0.1.6`).
3. Click the **OK** button.

To edit a dependency:

1. Select the module from the list of dependencies, and click the **Editâ€¦** button.
2. Update the module's name or version range as appropriate, or choose an entirely different module from the list to replace it. 
3. Click the **OK** button.

To remove a dependency, simply select the module from the list of dependencies and click the **Remove** button.

You also have the option of editing your module's metadata within the raw json format. If you click on the *JSON* tab, you will have access to the json information and may edit it directly as you wish.

###Publishing modules to the Forge

The [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/) is a repository of modules written by the Puppet community. Using and contributing to the Forge is a great way to crowdsource your work, and Geppetto makes publishing your modules to the Forge easy! 

Geppetto allows you to publish one or several modules, as well as allowing you to publish only specific parts of a module. To get started publishing modules to the Forge, make sure the *Project Explorer* window is open. Then, 

1. Right-click anywhere in the *Project Explorer* window OR choose **File** -> **Exportâ€¦** to open the Export Wizard.
2. In the *Export Wizard*, you can either type 'Forge' in text box OR expand the Puppet folder. 
3. Then choose **Export Modules to Forge** and click **Next**.
4. From here, you can choose to publish one or several modules, as well as choose what parts of the modules you would like to publish. 
    * To publish all of one or more modules, simply click the checkbox(es) next to the name of the project(s) housing the module. 
    * To publish only part of a module:
        1. Select the project name and choose the individual files to include by clicking the checkboxes next to those filenames, OR
        2. Click the arrow next to the project name and choose the individual folders/files by clicking the checkboxes next to the folder or filenames. 
5. Enter your Forge username and password in the text boxes below the pane where you selected your modules. (If you do not have a Forge username, see the instructions [here](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/modules_publishing.html#create-a-puppet-forge-account).)
6. Click **Finish**.

Geppetto will generate a pop up confirmation window when your modules have been uploaded successfully. Clicking **OK** on this confirmation message will bring you back to your main Geppetto screens. Otherwise, you will recieve a pop up stating there were problems. Clicking **OK** on this error message will bring you back to the *Export Wizard*.
