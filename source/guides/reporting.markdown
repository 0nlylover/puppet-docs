Reporting
=========

How to learn more about the activity of your nodes.

Stub
----

This documentation is a stub.  Reporting information on the Wiki is somewhat out of date
and we're working on rewriting it to bring you better reporting information.

In the meantime, look towards [Dashboard](/guides/installing_dashboard.html) as a good
way to gain a view into the activity of your nodes.

In future version of Puppet (Rowlf and beyond) reporting will be finer grained
and there will be more information and tips here.

Configuring Reporting
---------------------

TODO:  Add in information about how to configure reporting here.
