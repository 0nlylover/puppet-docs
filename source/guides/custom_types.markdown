Custom Types
============

Learn how to extend Puppet by writing your own types.

We are currently adapting our documentation on Puppet Types & Providers for inclusion in this document.
For now, see the [http://projects.reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Development_Creating_Custom_Types](Puppet Wiki) for
the latest information about adding new types (or providers) to your puppet installation.  It's a modular framework, so you
can extend Puppet without modifying the core.
