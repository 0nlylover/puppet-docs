Puppet Labs Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the Puppet Labs documentation site. The documentation posted here is also available as a set of PDFs, which can be found [here](http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-pdfs.html). You can also [download the current version of this entire website](./puppetdocs-latest.tar.gz) as a zipped archive; unzip it and follow the instructions in the README.txt file to view the site offline.

[Puppet](/puppet)
-----

Puppet is the best configuration management tool. Describe machine configurations in an easy-to-read declarative language, then let Puppet bring your systems into the desired state and keep them there. 

[See the index for Puppet's documentation here](/puppet), or go directly to one of the most popular pages:

- [The Learning Puppet series](/learning) is a guided tutorial for new users, which includes a free VM to run exercises on and experiment with. 
- [The language guide](/guides/language_guide.html) covers the syntax of the Puppet language. 
- [The latest type reference](/references/latest/type.html) covers all of the built-in resource types and their available attributes. New users should start elsewhere, but experienced users will spend most of their time in this one page. 
- [The installation guide](/guides/installation.html) can help you install and configure the current open-source Puppet releases.
- [The glossary](/references/glossary.html) explains the terminology you'll encounter when reading about Puppet.


[Puppet Enterprise](/pe/2.5)
-----

Puppet Enterprise is Puppet with more, including a production-grade puppet master stack, a web console for analyzing reports and controlling your infrastructure, powerful orchestration features, and cloud provisioning tools. 

Nearly all of the main Puppet documentation also applies to Puppet Enterprise. For details about PE's extra features and slightly different run environment, see [the current Puppet Enterprise user's guide](/pe/2.5/), or go directly to:

- [The system requirements](/pe/2.5/install_system_requirements.html)
- [The installation instructions](/pe/2.5/install_basic.html) or [the upgrade instructions](/pe/2.5/install_upgrading.html)
- [The quick start guide](/pe/2.5/quick_start.html), which walks through building and managing a small proof-of-concept deployment.
- [The PE download page](http://info.puppetlabs.com/download-pe.html)

The current version of PE is 2.5; documentation for previous versions can be found [here](/pe/index.html). 

[MCollective](/mcollective)
-----

MCollective is a powerful orchestration framework. Use existing plugins or write your own, and run actions on thousands of servers simultaneously. 

[See the MCollective docs index](/mcollective/), or go directly to:

- [The terminology glossary](/mcollective/terminology.html)
- [The installation instructions](/mcollective/reference/basic/gettingstarted.html)
- [The configuration guide](/mcollective/reference/basic/configuration.html)
- [The guide to writing new agent plugins](/mcollective/simplerpc/)

> Note: MCollective is included with Puppet Enterprise, and new agent plugins will appear in the console's live management controls.

[Puppet Dashboard](/dashboard/manual/1.2)
-----

Puppet Dashboard is a web console for Puppet, which can analyze reports, browse inventory data, and assign classes to nodes.

[See the Dashboard 1.2 manual](/dashboard/manual/1.2), or go directly to:

* [The installation instructions](/dashboard/manual/1.2/bootstrapping.html)
* [The configuration guide](/dashboard/manual/1.2/configuring.html)
* [The maintenance guide](/dashboard/manual/1.2/maintaining.html)

> Note: Puppet Enterprise's console is based on Puppet Dashboard, and extends it with extra features. PE users should see the PE documentation instead of the Dashboard documentation.

[PuppetDB](/puppetdb/0.9)
-----

PuppetDB is the fast, scalable, and reliable data warehouse for Puppet. It caches data generated by Puppet, and uses it to do awesome things. 

[See the PuppetDB 0.9 manual](/puppetdb/0.9), or go directly to:

* The installation instructions

Insert more about PuppetDB once the manual is alive.

Documentation Version
---------------------

This release of the documentation was generated from revision {% gitrevision %} of the [puppet-docs Git repo](http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs) on {{ 'now' | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}.
<!-- This used to be hardcoded as the sha of "master", since shenanigans with the "release" branch made HEAD unreliable. But now we can accurately call out the source version even when generating from a topic branch. -->
