Facter is Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables. 

* [The list of core facts](/facter/1.6/core_facts.html) lists and describes every built-in fact that ships with Facter. 
* [The custom facts guide](/guides/custom_facts.html) explains how to write and distribute your own facts.
