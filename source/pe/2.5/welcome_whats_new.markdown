Puppet Enterprise 2.5
-----

Version 2.5 is a major new release of Puppet Enterprise (PE). In addition to many fixes and refinements, PE 2.5 introduces the following new major features:

### ConsoleAuth

The Puppet Console now has support for role-based authentication. Users can access the Console with read-only, read-
write, or admin privileges. Puppet admins now have more information and options for managing Puppet users. <!-- For more information, see link. -->

### Windows Support

Puppet  can now be installed on agents running Windows Server 2003, 2008, or Windows 7. Windows agents have all basic Puppet functionality, including compliance support. Note however that MCollective,  live management, and the pe_accounts module are not yet supported on Windows agents. Support for these and other functions is already under development. Installation can be done via the command line or a Windows GUI-based installer. <!-- For more information, see link. -->

### Puppet Forge

Access to Puppet's online library of pre-built and tested configuration modules is integrated into the PE 2.5 redesigned module tool. By providing community-contributed and tested configurations, the Forge lets you solve configuration problems easily and get resources up and running quickly. Modules can be easily installed and uninstalled using the Puppet Module Tool. <!-- For more information, see link. -->
