New Features
========

Puppet Enterprise 2.5
-----

Version 2.5 is a major new release of Puppet Enterprise (PE). In addition to many fixes and refinements, PE 2.5 introduces the following new major features:

### ConsoleAuth

The Puppet Console now has support for role-based authentication. Users can access the Console with read-only, read-
write, or admin privileges. Puppet admins now have more information and options for managing Puppet users.

### Windows Support
Puppet  can now be installed on agents running Windows Server 2003, 2008, and Windows 7. Note that MCollective,  live management, and the pe_accounts module are not yet supported on Windows agents. However, support for these and other functions is already under development. Installation can be done via the command line or a Windows GUI-based installer.

### Puppet Data Library

The Puppet Data Library provides access to comprehensive data about all aspects of infrastructure changes. The data can be used to provide insight into how infrastructure changes affect service levels or to generate automated reports for IT compliance audits or other reporting needs. In addition, third-party developers have created new management tools that take advantage of the information provided by the Puppet Data Library.

### Puppet Forge

Puppet's online library of pre-built and tested configuration modules is integrated into PE 2.5. By providing community-contributed and tested configurations, the Forge lets you solve configuration problems easily and get resources up and running quickly. Modules can be easily installed and uninstalled using the Puppet Module Tool.
