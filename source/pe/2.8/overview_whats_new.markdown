    1. New Support for AIX
        New in Puppet Enterprise, the puppet agent can now be installed on nodes running AIX so you can manage them using PE. To help you configure AIX nodes, support for AIX package providers, RPM, NIM and BFF, has been added as well. For information on installation on AIX nodes, check the [systems requirements](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/2.8/install_system_requirements.html) and refer to the [installing PE page](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/2.8/install_basic.html). The type reference has more information on [AIX package] providers(http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#package)
