### Version 2.8.0
PE 2.8.0 is a feature release. There are two major new additions to PE:
    1. Support for AIX
        The puppet agent can now be installed on nodes running AIX so you can manage them using PE. To help you configure AIX nodes, support for AIX package providers, RPM, NIM and BFF has been added as well. For information on installation on AIX nodes, check the [systems requirements](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/2.7/install_system_requirements.html) and refer to the [installing PE page](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/2.7/install_basic.html).
    
    2. Integration with PuppetDB
    
    It modifies the way PE manages auth_conf, fixes an issue with puppet's augeas lenses, and adds several patches to address security issues. See the [Appendix](appendix.html#release-notes) for release notes detailing the changes.
