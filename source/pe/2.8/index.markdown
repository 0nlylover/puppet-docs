[2.8.0fix]: https://puppetlabs.com/puppet-enterprise-hotfixes-2-8-0/

Welcome! This is the user's guide for Puppet Enterprise 2.8.

> **Note (April 5, 2013):** We've temporarily pulled Puppet Enterprise 2.8.0 from our download page, due to a packaging bug that prevents MCollective filters and the console’s live management feature from functioning.
>
> We plan to release a fixed PE 2.8.1 sometime next week. If you are currently running 2.8.0, we've prepared a partial upgrade package which fully resolves this issue; you can [download the fix here.][2.8.0fix]
