Razor is an advanced provisioning application that can deploy both bare metal and virtual systems. It's aimed at solving the problem of how to bring new computers into a state that your existing configuration management system, Puppet Enterprise, can then take over. 

##High-level Overview

<description + graphic>

The process for provisioning with Razor roughly follows these steps:

+ [Set Up a Virtual Environment for Razor](./razor_prereqs)
+ [Install and set up a Razor Server and Razor Client](./razor_install.html)
+ [Create Razor objects and provision machines](./razor_using.html)


In addition to the above processes, learn more about:

+ [Razor objects](./razor_objects.html)
+ [Write Razor tasks](./razor_tasks.html)
+ [Razor reference](./razor_reference.html)

 
###Razor As Tech Preview

This is a Tech Preview release of Razor. This means you are getting early access to Razor technology so you can test the functionality and provide feedback. However, this Tech Preview version of Razor is not intended for production use because Puppet Labs cannot guarantee Razor's stability. As Razor is further developed, functionality might be added, removed or change that is not backward compatible with this Tech Preview version.

For more information about Tech Preview software from Puppet Labs, see <link to be written>.
