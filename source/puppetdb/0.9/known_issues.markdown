Longer-Term Design Issues

### Autorequire relationships are opaque

We don't correctly model dependencies between Puppet resources that have an auto-require relationship. If you have 2 file resources where one is a parent directory of the other, Puppet will automatically create a dependency such that the child requires the parent. The problem is that such a dependency is *not* reflected in the catalog...the catalog, as currently represented, contains no hint that such a relationship ever existed.
