### Autorequire relationships are opaque

We don't correctly model dependencies between Puppet resources that have an auto-require relationship. For example, if you have two file resources where one is a parent directory of the other, Puppet will automatically create a dependency such that the child requires the parent. The problem is that such a dependency is *not* reflected in the catalog; puppet agent creates these relationships on the fly when it reads the catalog. 

Showing these relationships in PuppetDB will require a significant change to Puppet's core.
