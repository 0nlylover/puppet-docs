Basic Requirements
-----

Puppet 3 has the following prerequisites:

### Ruby

Use one of the following versions of MRI (standard) Ruby:

* 1.8.7
* 1.9.3
* 2.0.x
* 2.1.x --- **Note:** We run spec tests for Ruby 2.1, but since none of our tested platforms ship with it yet, we don't run acceptance tests on it. This means we think it's good, but it might have problems we don't know about yet.

Other interpreters and versions of Ruby are not covered by our tests, and may or may not work.

### Facter

- [Facter](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/) 1.7.0 or later

### Hiera

- [Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/latest/) 1.0 or later

### Optional: the `rgen` Ruby Gem

If you are using Puppet [with `parser = future` enabled](./experiments_future.html), you will need:

- [rgen gem](http://ruby-gen.org/downloads) 0.6.1 or later

Puppet Labs's official packages will install rgen as a dependency, as will the Puppet gem. If you are installing Puppet manually or with unofficial packages, rgen is optional.
