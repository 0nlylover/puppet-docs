Basic Requirements
-----

If you're installing Puppet via the official packages, you won't need to worry about these prerequisites; your system's package manager will handle all of them. These are only listed for those running Puppet from source or on unsupported systems.

Puppet 3.5 has the following prerequisites:

### Ruby

Use one of the following versions of MRI (standard) Ruby:

* 1.8.7
* 1.9.3
* 2.0.x
* 2.1.x --- **Note:** We run spec tests for Ruby 2.1, but since none of our tested platforms ship with it yet, we don't run acceptance tests on it. This means we think it's good, but it might have problems we don't know about yet.

Other interpreters and versions of Ruby are not covered by our tests, and may or may not work.

### Mandatory Libraries

- [Facter](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/related-projects/facter/) 1.7.0 or later
- [Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/latest/) 1.0 or later
- The `json` gem (any modern version).

### Optional Libraries

- The [`rgen` gem](http://ruby-gen.org/downloads) version 0.6.1 or later is required when using Puppet [with `parser = future` enabled](./experiments_future.html).
- The `msgpack` gem is required if you are using [msgpack serialization](./experiments_msgpack.html).
