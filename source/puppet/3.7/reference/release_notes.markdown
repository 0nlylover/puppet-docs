This page tells the history of the Puppet 3.7 series. (Elsewhere: release notes for [Puppet 3.0 -- 3.4][puppet_3], [Puppet 3.5][puppet_35], and [Puppet 3.6][puppet_36].)

Puppet's version numbers use the format X.Y.Z, where:

* X must increase for major backwards-incompatible changes
* Y may increase for backwards-compatible new functionality
* Z may increase for bug fixes

How to Upgrade
-----

If you're upgrading from a 3.x version of Puppet, you can usually just go for it. Upgrade your puppet master servers before upgrading the agents they serve. (But do look at the table of contents above and see if there are any "Upgrade Warning" notes for the new version.)

If you're upgrading from Puppet 2.x, please [learn about major upgrades of Puppet first!][upgrade] We have important advice about upgrade plans and package management practices. The short version is: test first, roll out in stages, give yourself plenty of time to work with. Also, read the [release notes for Puppet 3][puppet_3] for a list of all the breaking changes made between the 2.x and 3.x series.
