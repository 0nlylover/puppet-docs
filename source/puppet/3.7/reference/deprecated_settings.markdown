title: "Deprecated Settings"
---




The following Puppet settings are deprecated and will be removed in Puppet 4.0. Many of them are related to other deprecated features.


Config File Environment Settings
-----

* [`manifest`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#manifest)
* [`modulepath`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#modulepath)
* [`config_version`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#configversion)

### Now

You can set global values for the [`manifest`][manifest_setting], [`modulepath`][modulepath_setting], and [`config_version`][config_version] settings in [puppet.conf][].

### In Puppet 4.0

The `manifest`, `modulepath`, and `config_version` settings are not allowed in [puppet.conf][]. They can be configured per-environment in [environment.conf][].

### Detecting and Updating

If you are using config file environments, your Puppet masters will log deprecation warnings about it.

Read the page on [config file environments][], and remove the relevant settings and sections from puppet.conf on your Puppet masters. Then, switch to using [directory environments][].

### Context

See the note about [the deprecation of config file environments.](./deprecated_misc.html#config-file-environments)


Activerecord Storeconfigs Settings
-----

* [`async_storeconfigs`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#asyncstoreconfigs)
* [`dbadapter`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbadapter)
* [`dbconnections`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbconnections)
* [`dblocation`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dblocation)
* [`dbmigrate`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbmigrate)
* [`dbname`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbname)
* [`dbpassword`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbpassword)
* [`dbport`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbport)
* [`dbserver`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbserver)
* [`dbsocket`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbsocket)
* [`dbuser`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dbuser)
* [`queue_source`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#queuesource)
* [`queue_type`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#queuetype)
* [`rails_loglevel`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#railsloglevel)
* [`railslog`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#railslog)
* [`thin_storeconfigs`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#thinstoreconfigs)

### Now

Activerecord-based storeconfigs still works, and these settings configure various parts of it.

### In Puppet 4.0

It's gone, and so are these settings. Use PuppetDB instead.

### Detecting and Updating

Look for the settings in your Puppet master config files and delete them. Install PuppetDB.

### Context

Activerecord storeconfigs was an old and slow system that could do only a fraction of what PuppetDB does, and it did it badly.


Inventory Service Settings
-----

* [`inventory_port`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#inventoryport)
* [`inventory_server`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#inventoryserver)
* [`inventory_terminus`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#inventoryterminus)

### Now

These settings configure the deprecated inventory service.

### In Puppet 4.0

The inventory service is gone, as are the settings.

### Detecting and Updating

If you or your applications use the inventory service, you should switch to [PuppetDB][]. Delete these settings from puppet.conf on your Puppet master(s), install PuppetDB, and change any custom code to speak directly to PuppetDB's API.

### Context

The inventory service could do a fraction of what PuppetDB does, and with a slower and less flexible API. It's been replaced.

Other Settings
-----

### `allow_variables_with_dashes`

* [`allow_variables_with_dashes`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#allowvariableswithdashes)

#### Now

This setting once permitted hyphens in variable names, but no longer works.

#### In Puppet 4.0

This setting is removed.

#### Detecting and Updating

If this is set in puppet.conf on your master(s), you'll need to delete it.

#### Context

This setting was designed to reduce the damage from a pair of bad decisions we made in the Puppet 2.7 era. Hyphenated variables cause major problems in the language.

### `catalog_format`

* [`catalog_format`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#catalogformat)

#### Now

This setting is deprecated.

#### In Puppet 4.0

This setting is gone. Use `preferred_serialization_format` instead.

#### Detecting and Updating

Search your puppet.conf file on agent nodes for the name of the setting.

#### Context

This setting is replaced by the [`preferred_serialization_format`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#preferredserializationformat) setting.

### `dynamicfacts`

* [`dynamicfacts`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#dynamicfacts)

#### Now

This setting is not functional, but you can still set it in puppet.conf. It causes a deprecation warning.

#### In Puppet 4.0

This setting has been removed.

#### Detecting and Updating

Deprecation warning:

    The dynamicfacts setting is deprecated and will be ignored.

#### Context

This setting was intended to ignore dynamic facts when deciding whether changed facts should result in a recompile, but was never implemented.

### `listen`

* [`listen`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#listen)

#### Now

Setting `listen = true` will cause `puppet agent` to listen for incoming connections on port 8140.

#### In Puppet 4.0

The setting is removed.

#### Detecting and Updating

See [the note on `puppet kick`.](./deprecated_command.html#puppet-kick)

#### Context

See [the note on `puppet kick`.](./deprecated_command.html#puppet-kick)


### `manifestdir`

* [`manifestdir`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#manifestdir)

#### Now

This setting is used to construct the default value of the `manifest` setting. It has no other purpose. However, the directory it specifies has to exist, or else Puppet will raise an error.

#### In Puppet 4.0

The setting is gone and its directory doesn't have to exist.

#### Detecting and Updating

No action is needed to update the behavior.

#### Context

Setting a global value for manifest in puppet.conf is deprecated. Use directory environments instead.

### `masterlog`

* [`masterlog`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#masterlog)

#### Now

This setting is not functional, but it can be set in puppet.conf.

#### In Puppet 4.0

The setting is removed.

#### Detecting and Updating

No action is needed. If you have the setting set and you upgrade, Puppet will give an error and ask you to remove it.

#### Context

This setting once could specify where the Puppet master logged, but it has not worked in some time. Syslog is the default log destination.

### `stringify_facts = true`

* [`stringify_facts`](/references/latest/configuration.html#stringifyfacts)

#### Now

It defaults to true

#### In Puppet 4.0

it's still around but defaults to false

#### Detecting and Updating

No warning. Set it to false and see if anything blows up.

#### Context

This should only affect you if you have custom facts that na√Øvely return something other than a string (a bool, an array...) and you have regexes or something that rely on that implicit stringification behavior.

* [PUP-406: Deprecate stringify_fact = true](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-406)


### `templatedir`

* [`templatedir`](/references/3.7.latest/configuration.html#templatedir)

#### Now

When given a relative path, the [`template` function](/references/3.7.latest/function.html#template) will try to find templates in this directory before trying to find them in modules.

#### In Puppet 4.0

The `template` function will only search modules when given a relative path.

#### Detecting and Updating

No warning.

Look for it in puppet.conf on your master(s), see if the directory exists, see if there's anything in the directory. If so, you'll need to identify any Puppet code that references those templates, move the templates into modules, and change the code that refers to them so they can find them in their new homes.

#### Context

This setting and its behavior predate Puppet's module system. Now that all templates should go in modules, it adds unnecessary complexity.
