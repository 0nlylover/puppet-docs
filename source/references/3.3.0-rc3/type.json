For example, removing a `minute => 10` parameter\nwill not reset the minute component of the associated cronjob to `*`.\nThese changes must be expressed by setting the parameter to\n`minute => absent` because Puppet only manages parameters that are out of\nsync with manifest entries.\n","providers":{"crontab":{"description":"Required binaries: `crontab`.","features":[]}},"features":{}},"filebucket":{"attributes":{"path":{"description":"The path to the _local_ filebucket; defaults to the value of the\n`clientbucketdir` setting.

All\npuppet masters provide a filebucket service that agent nodes can access\nvia HTTP, but you must declare a filebucket resource before any agents\nwill do so.\n\nFilebuckets are used for the following features:\n\n- **Content backups.** If the `file` type's `backup` attribute is set to\n  the name of a filebucket, Puppet will back up the _old_ content whenever\n  it rewrites a file; see the documentation for the `file` type for more\n  details. These backups can be used for manual recovery of content, but\n  are more commonly used to display changes and differences in a tool like\n  Puppet Dashboard.\n- **Content distribution.** The optional static compiler populates the\n  puppet master's filebucket with the _desired_ content for each file,\n  then instructs the agent to retrieve the content for a specific\n  checksum. For more details,\n  [see the `static_compiler` section in the catalog indirection docs](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/indirection.html#catalog).\n\nTo use a central filebucket for backups, you will usually want to declare\na filebucket resource and a resource default for the `backup` attribute\nin site.pp:\n\n    # /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp\n    filebucket { 'main':\n      path   => false,                # This is required for remote filebuckets.\n      server => 'puppet.example.com', # Optional; defaults to the configured puppet master.\n    }\n\n    File { backup => main, }\n\nPuppet master servers automatically provide the filebucket service, so\nthis will work in a default configuration. If you have a heavily\nrestricted `auth.conf` file, you may need to allow access to the\n`file_bucket_file` endpoint.\n","providers":{},"features":{}},"maillist":{"attributes":{"description":{"description":"The description of the mailing list.","namevar":false,"kind":"parameter"},"webserver":{"description":"The name of the host providing web archives and the administrative interface.","namevar":false,"kind":"parameter"},"mailserver":{"description":"The name of the host handling email for the list.","namevar":false,"kind":"parameter"},"admin":{"description":"The email address of the administrator.","namevar":false,"kind":"parameter"},"provider":{"description":"The specific backend to use for this `maillist`\nresource.

Resources can be limited to a schedule by using the\n[`schedule`](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/metaparameter.html#schedule)\nmetaparameter.\n\nCurrently, **schedules can only be used to stop a resource from being\napplied;** they cannot cause a resource to be applied when it otherwise\nwouldn't be, and they cannot accurately specify a time when a resource\nshould run.\n\nEvery time Puppet applies its configuration, it will apply the\nset of resources whose schedule does not eliminate them from\nrunning right then, but there is currently no system in place to\nguarantee that a given resource runs at a given time.  If you\nspecify a very  restrictive schedule and Puppet happens to run at a\ntime within that schedule, then the resources will get applied;\notherwise, that work may never get done.\n\nThus, it is advisable to use wider scheduling (e.g., over a couple of\nhours) combined with periods and repetitions.  For instance, if you\nwanted to restrict certain resources to only running once, between\nthe hours of two and 4 AM, then you would use this schedule:\n\n    schedule { 'maint':\n      range  => \"2 - 4\",\n      period => daily,\n      repeat => 1,\n    }\n\nWith this schedule, the first time that Puppet runs between 2 and 4 AM,\nall resources with this schedule will get applied, but they won't\nget applied again between 2 and 4 because they will have already\nrun once that day, and they won't get applied outside that schedule\nbecause they will be outside the scheduled range.\n\nPuppet automatically creates a schedule for each of the valid periods\nwith the same name as that period (e.g., hourly and daily).\nAdditionally, a schedule named `puppet` is created and used as the\ndefault, with the following attributes:\n\n    schedule { 'puppet':\n      period => hourly,\n      repeat => 2,\n    }\n\nThis will cause resources to be applied every 30 minutes by default.\n","providers":{},"features":{}},"selmodule":{"attributes":{"selmodulepath":{"description":"The full path to the compiled .pp policy module.
